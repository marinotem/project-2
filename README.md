This is our analysis of homicides vs. weather conditions to see if there is a correlation between weather such as humidity, events and temperature with homicide rates.

First we have to clean the data, match the data and load it. 

Some of our csv files are too big, so the Resources folder is included in the .gitignore file incase if needed
